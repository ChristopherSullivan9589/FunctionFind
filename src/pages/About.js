Function Find was born out of a passion for events and technology. Our founders noticed how hard it could be to find and attend local events without spending hours searching through different apps and websites. Inspired by interactive apps like Pok√©mon Go, they set out to create a platform that brings events to life in a whole new way. Today, Function Find helps users discover parties, concerts, and local functions using an intuitive 3D map, making it easier than ever to explore what your city has to offer.
